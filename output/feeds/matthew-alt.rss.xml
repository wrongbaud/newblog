We will then demonstrate how to use the PiFex to access a JTAG tap on an undocumented SSD, allowing memory reads and GDB access to the SSD CPU.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">"Matthew Alt"</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2024-05-05:/newblog/jtag-pifex.html</guid><category>Pifex</category><category>pifex</category><category>jtag</category><category>hardware</category><category>blog</category></item><item><title>VoidStar Security - 2023 Year In Review</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/2023-year-in-review.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As we reach the end of the year, I want to thank everyone for their continued support and business. 2023 was a great year for training and consulting. We worked with companies ranging from 4000 to 15 members, all of which brought unique perspectives to our course material and allowed us to expand on new topics and targets. A big thanks to all those who reached out for onsite training in 2023 and those who contracted with us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">"Matthew Alt"</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2023-12-29:/newblog/2023-year-in-review.html</guid><category>Training</category><category>hardware</category><category>blog</category><category>tools</category></item><item><title>Replicant: Reproducing a Fault Injection Attack on the Trezor One</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/replicant-part-1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post aims to provide a road map and example of how to replicate a fault injection attack and the hurdles and shortcomings that can occur when attempting to do so. Furthermore, by outlining the process of replicating one of these attacks, we hope that readers come away from this post more confident in generating their own fault injection attacks or replicating pre-existing work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">"Matthew Alt"</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2022-08-19:/newblog/replicant-part-1.html</guid><category>Glitching</category><category>fault-injection</category><category>chipwhisperer</category></item><item><title>Intro to Embedded RE: UART Discovery and Firmware Extraction via UBoot</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/uart-uboot-and-usb.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This blog entry aims to familiarize readers with locating an active UART on a target system, how to approach a UBoot console, and ultimately how to leverage both of these components to extract the flash memory from our target.
