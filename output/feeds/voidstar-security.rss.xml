We worked with companies ranging from 4000 to 15 members, all of which brought unique perspectives to our course material and allowed us to expand on new topics and targets. A big thanks to all those who reached out for onsite training in 2023 and those who contracted with us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">VoidStar Security</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2023-12-29:/newblog/voidstar-security-2023-year-in-review.html</guid><category>blog</category><category>hardware</category><category>blog</category><category>tools</category></item><item><title>"On the Road at the Leahy Center: Our first in-person training of 2022!"</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/on-the-road-at-the-leahy-center-our-first-in-person-training-of-2022.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description of the on-site course at Leahy Center&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">VoidStar Security</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2022-11-11:/newblog/on-the-road-at-the-leahy-center-our-first-in-person-training-of-2022.html</guid><category>training</category><category>training</category><category>blog</category></item><item><title>"Replicant: Reproducing a Fault Injection Attack on the Trezor One"</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/replicant-reproducing-a-fault-injection-attack-on-the-trezor-one.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post aims to provide a road map and example of how to replicate a fault injection attack and the hurdles and shortcomings that can occur when attempting to do so. Furthermore, by outlining the process of replicating one of these attacks, we hope that readers come away from this post more confident in generating their own fault injection attacks or replicating pre-existing work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">VoidStar Security</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2022-08-19:/newblog/replicant-reproducing-a-fault-injection-attack-on-the-trezor-one.html</guid><category>Glitching</category><category>fault-injection</category><category>chipwhisperer</category></item><item><title>"Intro to Embedded RE: UART Discovery and Firmware Extraction via UBoot "</title><link>https://wrongbaud.github.io/newblog/intro-to-embedded-re-uart-discovery-and-firmware-extraction-via-uboot.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This blog entry aims to familiarize readers with locating an active UART on a target system, how to approach a UBoot console, and ultimately how to leverage both of these components to extract the flash memory from our target.

There will be two sections, one for hardware tools and one for software tools. After reading this blog post, the reader should know what is needed to set up an introductory lab for reverse engineering embedded systems and firmware images.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">VoidStar Security</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:wrongbaud.github.io,2022-01-17:/newblog/intro-to-embedded-re-part-1-tools-and-series-overview.html</guid><category>blog</category><category>hardware</category><category>uart</category><category>uboot</category></item></channel></rss>
