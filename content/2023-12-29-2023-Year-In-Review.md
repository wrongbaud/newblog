# VoidStar Security - 2023 Year In Review 

## Overview

As we reach the end of the year, I want to thank everyone for their continued support and business. 2023 was a great year for training and consulting. We worked with companies ranging from 4000 to 15 members, all of which brought unique perspectives to our course material and allowed us to expand on new topics and targets. A big thanks to all those who reached out for onsite training in 2023 and those who contracted with us! 

One of our most significant updates this year was a refactor of our [website](https://voidstarsec.com); it contains more training information, including our DUNS number, past talks, and free resources we have developed. 

While we only published one [blog](https://voidstarsec.com/blog) entry this year - [A Guide to Building a Hardware Hacking Lab](https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/). We have been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work that will be coming out in 2024, including conference talks, new tools, and new training!

## 2024 Updates

2024 is already leading up to be an exciting year at VoidStar; in February, I will be speaking at the [RingZero](https://ringzer0.training/) conference about breaking RDP protections on the STM32F4 series using a targeted Electro-magnetic Fault Injection (EMFI) attack. More information about the talk can be found at the link [here](https://ringzer0.training/sessions/glitching-in-3d-low-cost-emfi-attacks.html). Following this talk will be a long-form blog post and tool release, including all the tools developed to help perform this EMFI attack. Expect to see more EMFI work from us in 2024!

## Training Updates

We've been working hard to add new training materials for 2024, including a new [firmware reverse engineering](https://voidstarsec.com/syllabi/VSS_FAF_Syllabus.pdf) course and a fault injection course. If you want to learn more about these courses, check out our website's [training section](https://voidstarsec.com/#training). We are accepting requests for onsite training in 2024, but slots are filling up fast!

We have also made many updates to our [Hardware Hacking Bootcamp](https://voidstarsec.com/syllabi/VSS_HHB_Syllabus.pdf), including the addition of new targets and modules such as ETM Tracing, advanced JTAG labs, and advanced UBoot attacks.

We've also designed a new tool, the PiFex, a universal interface board that makes it easy to take advantage of all of the commonly needed peripherals on the Raspberry Pi when performing hardware attacks. It also features built-in level shifters and an OLED screen.

## Closing Thoughts

In closing, thank you all for an incredible 2023. I am excited to see where 2024 takes VoidStar, and I hope that you will be a part of our journey! If you are interested in scheduling an onsite training, or are looking for assistance with firmware extraction, fault injection or firmware reverse engineering, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://voidstarsec.com/#contact).[Our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/hSl31f) is also a great way to stay informed on new courses, tools that we are using, blog posts, and upcoming course offerings.
